<b>Background</b><p>
Microbial collections based exclusively on axenic cultures are time consuming, costly and may result in the loss of relevant biological information, since there are microorganisms that might depend on microbe-microbe interactions for their growth. As an alternative, we explore the concept of community-based culture collections (CBC) that is based on the isolation of colonies containing single or multiple microorganisms. By using this approach, we created a community-based culture collection with isolates from sugarcane plant organs. We developed a method to annotate the community-based isolates through a multiplex strategy for pooling and sequencing near-full-length ribosomal gene amplicons. These method provide a high-throughput strategy for identifying isolated microbes in culture collection and allow fast and accurate cross-referencing with culture-independent community profiling. This dataset contain reads from five plates that were used to the development of these methodologies.

"CBC" is a program that combine four independent scripts.
Scripts were designed to optimize demultiplexing, quality filtering of sequences and clustering.
The scripts were tested in a dataset of a community-based culture collection and described in:

The scripts that have been used is being polished from personal comments and customizations.
We will make it available as soon as possible.
